pairfind
========

Find string pairs across multiple sets

Write a program that, using this file as input, produces a list of pairs of artists which appear TOGETHER in at least fifty different lists. For example, in the above sample, Radiohead and Morrissey appear together twice, but every other pair appears only once. Your program should output the pair list to stdout in the same form as the input (eg Artist Name 1, Artist Name 2\n).
